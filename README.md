# Prostate-Cancer-Study
Final Project from my Applied Genomics class at NYU during Spring '15

This has a mix of R, Python and BASH/Shell Code. This project was a  
Bioinformatics study comparing RNA seq data from Primary Prostate Tumors
(T2 and T3 stages) with Bone Mets from prostate cancer.  All the data was
obtained from NCBI.  

The primary tumor data came from this study:
The Bone Tumor data came from this study:

The analysis features the use of a number of Bioinformatics tools; such as,
STAR, DEseq2, GAGE, Pathview, etc...
